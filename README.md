I designed and developed a simple static weather web application that integrates with the WeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information for a user's specified location. The application's clean and user-friendly interface displays current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data, making it easy for users to stay informed and plan their day accordingly.
